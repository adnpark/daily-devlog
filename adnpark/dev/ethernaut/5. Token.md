# 5. Token

The goal of this level is for you to hack the basic token contract below.

You are given 20 tokens to start with and you will beat the level if you somehow manage to get your hands on any additional tokens. Preferably a very large amount of tokens.

Things that might help:

- What is an odometer?

```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

contract Token {

  mapping(address => uint) balances;
  uint public totalSupply;

  constructor(uint _initialSupply) public {
    balances[msg.sender] = totalSupply = _initialSupply;
  }

  function transfer(address _to, uint _value) public returns (bool) {
    require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);
    balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
    balances[_to] += _value;
    return true;
  }

  function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint balance) {
    return balances[_owner];
  }
}
```

Overflows are very common in solidity and must be checked for with control statements such as:

```
if(a + c > a) {
  a = a + c;
}

```

An easier alternative is to use OpenZeppelin's SafeMath library that automatically checks for overflows in all the mathematical operators. The resulting code looks like this:

```
a = a.add(c);

```

If there is an overflow, the code will revert.
